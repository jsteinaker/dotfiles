# rawdelete v.0.1, script used to delete RAW files if there's no corresponding JPG
#
# In-camera software deletes both files (RAW and JPG) at the same time.
# That's convenient, because when you try to get rid of a bad picture,
# you don't want any of the files. When on a computer, one can hop through
# the JPGs, delete the unwanted, and then run this script to get rid
# of the corresponding CR2 files.
#
# Known bugs:
# - File extensions are hardcoded

CR2_FILES="`ls -1 | grep -i cr2`"
JPG_FILES="`ls -1 | grep -i jpg`"
